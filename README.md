# Loan Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes financial loan data to extract key insights into lending patterns, borrower behavior, and loan performance. Using SQL queries, we examine trends in loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and borrower risk profiles.

## Key Analyses

## 1. Loan Applications Trends

Total Applications: Calculates the total number of loan applications received.

Month-to-Date (MTD) Applications: Tracks loan applications for the latest month.

Month-over-Month (MoM) Change: Analyzes application trends over time.

## 2. Loan Funding Analysis

Total Funded Amount: Summarizes the total disbursed loan amount.

MTD Funded Amount: Tracks funding in the latest month.

MoM Change in Funding: Identifies changes in loan disbursement.

## 3. Loan Repayment & Cash Flow

Total Payments Received: Measures borrower repayments.

MTD Repayment Trends: Tracks month-to-date repayment trends.

MoM Change in Repayments: Assesses fluctuations in cash flow.

## 4. Interest Rate Analysis

Average Interest Rate: Computes the average lending rate.

MTD Interest Rate Trends: Tracks recent changes.

MoM Change in Interest Rates: Monitors fluctuations.

## 5. Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio

Average DTI Ratio: Measures borrower financial health.

MTD DTI Trends: Tracks recent borrower debt ratios.

MoM Change in DTI: Monitors changes in borrower risk.

## 6. Loan Risk Profile

Prime vs. Subprime Applications: Compares loan approvals for high vs. low-risk borrowers.

Funded Amount & Repayments by Risk Category: Tracks lending behavior by risk profile.

## 7. Loan Status Breakdown

Loan Status Grid: Categorizes loans by status (e.g., fully paid, defaulted, etc.).

MTD Status Overview: Tracks month-to-date loan performance.

## 8. Loan Issuance Trends

Monthly Trends: Identifies seasonality in lending activities.

Regional Loan Analysis: Compares lending volume by state.

## 9. Borrower Demographics & Loan Characteristics

Loan Terms Analysis: Examines loan distributions by term length.

Employment Length & Loan Performance: Identifies lending patterns based on employment history.

Loan Purpose Analysis: Tracks the primary reasons for borrowing.

Home Ownership & Lending Trends: Analyzes how homeownership affects loan applications.

## SQL Queries

The project includes SQL queries to extract insights from financial loan data. Each query is structured to provide:

Overall trend analysis (e.g., total applications, funded amounts, interest rates)

MTD calculations to track real-time performance

MoM comparisons to analyze growth and seasonality

## How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone (https://github.com/jsaini03/Bank-Financial-Report-With-SQL-PowerBI.git)

Run the SQL queries using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any SQL database platform.

Modify queries as needed to customize the analysis.
